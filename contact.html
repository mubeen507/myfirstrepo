- Git is a free and open source Distributed Version Control System designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS etc 

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every user has a full copy of the repository on their local machine. Git does not require a central server to store all versions of the code, although it is possible to set up a central repository that multiple users can push changes to.
